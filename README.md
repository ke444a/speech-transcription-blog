# Video transcription app

## Description
This is a Next.js application that makes use of Firebase and OpenAI API to transcribe any uploaded video. The user uploads the video to the application, which is then uploaded to Firebase storage. The application then sends the video to the Whisper API by OpenAI, which transcribes the video and returns the transcription. The app backend runs on Firebase Cloud Functions.<br /><br /> 

This project is motivated by my technical blog hosted on [Hashnode](https://blog.danylkecha.com). I have released a blog post that offers a detailed step-by-step guide covering every aspect of the project. You can check it out here: https://blog.danylkecha.com/series/video-transcript <br /><br />
